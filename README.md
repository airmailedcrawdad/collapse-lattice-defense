**Defensive publications on collapse-lattice processors and warp-bubble analog devices, establishing prior art while reserving all rights.**

---

This repository preserves **open defensive publications** on novel collapse-lattice architectures.  
It documents two complementary disclosures:  
- a **metric-analog warp device** engineered via collapse-coordinate modulation, and  
- a **neutral collapse-lattice processor** that achieves invariant-locked transport control.  

The goal is to ensure these ideas remain part of the **public domain of science**, serving as prior art against privatization while all rights remain reserved by the author.
